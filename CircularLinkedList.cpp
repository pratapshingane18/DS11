/*The Linked List in which the last Node points on first Node is called Circular Linked List
Their is no first or last node as the nodes are circcular
We use the term Head Node;

Benefit:
we can traverse the Nodes Circularly
In  many Applications we find that the things are handeled circuarly
e.g. contact List In some Mobile Phone

 When to Use:
 When you only have one direction access and you want a circular access
